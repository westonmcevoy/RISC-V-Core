Phase 2Wes McEvoyResult value for wmcevoy2.c = 8855 or 0x2297Result value for wmcevoy2.s = 0x2297 or 8855Time spent on C-program checkpoint -> 10 minutes	I rate it as easy to write and debugTime spent on assembly program checkpoint -> 30 minutes	I rate it as moderate to write and difficult to debugTime spent converting assembly to machine code -> 20 minutes	I used the shortcut and rate it as moderate to write and very difficult to debugSummariesC vs. assembly	Both are relatively easy to write but I had to look up many assembly commands to learn their use and structure. C takes less time because I know it by heart. Debugging assembly is much harder because you have to look at registers and memory as opposed to error messages.Assembly vs. machine code	Assembly is much easier because it doesn’t require hexadecimal conversions. There is a lot less potential to make mistakes.C vs. machine code	This is a no brainer because I already am proficient in C. Without the shortcut I would have to convert every assembly instruction to machine code by hand. One conversion may take as long as it took me to write the entire C program.
